## 👨‍💻 About Me
# Hey there, I’m Nishchay Sharma 

>*Mechanical Engineer | Design Enthusiast | Problem Solver*

Welcome to my space on GitHub! I’m someone who enjoys bringing ideas to life through CAD, clean design, and solid engineering logic. I graduated with top honors in Mechanical Engineering. From intricate mechanisms to futuristic concepts, I blend precision with creativity to craft models that resonate who transforms ideas into tangible designs.

Here, you'll find a mix of creative CAD models, mechanical concepts, and side projects I’m genuinely proud of. Whether it’s an energy regen system or a fully modeled fighter jet, I like building things that make sense and look good doing it.
